## Overview

This repository hosts an interactive, visually engaging e-commerce sales dashboard designed to empower stakeholders with clear insights into:

* Key **Sales Performance** metrics (e.g., total sales, month-over-month growth)
* **Revenue & Profit Trends** with year-over-year or period-over-period comparisons
* **Customer Behavior** including segmentation and ordering patterns
* **Product and Regional Analysis** highlighting top-performing categories and locations

The dashboard uses intuitive charts and KPIs to surface actionable insights, making it accessible to users across technical skill levels.

---

## Features

* **Interactive KPIs & slicers**: Easily filter by region, product category, date range, and more
* **Rich visualizations**: Includes line charts, bar charts, pie/donut charts, maps, and trend analyses
* **Calculated metrics**: Custom measures such as Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Profit Margin, Average Order Value, etc.
* **Data drill-down** capability for deep-dives
* **Professional-ready visuals** with responsive design and clean theming

---

## Technology Stack

* **.pbip file** – Likely built using **Power BI Desktop**, given the `.pbip` extension 
* **CSV data sources** – Two CSV files included: `Orders.csv` and `Details.csv` 
* **Visual assets** – A background or design image is available (`dark-gradient.jpg`) 
* **Potential use of DAX or Power Query** for data modeling and KPI logic (assumed common in dashboard builds)

Adjust this section if your dashboard uses additional technologies (e.g., Python, SQL, React).

---

## Data

The repository includes the following data files:

* `Orders.csv`: Likely contains transactional order data
* `Details.csv`: Possibly holds line-item or product-level details

These are the sources powering the visual analyses in the `.pbip` dashboard. Ensure that any data refresh or customization references these files correctly.
